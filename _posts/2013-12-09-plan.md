I'm wary of giving specific dates for building the website so I'll organize
myself by listing a series of steps that I need to accomplish.

* Laying the foundation ([post][p1], [commit][c1]).

* Setting up the deployment process ([post][p2], [commit][c2]).

* Creating the user authentication.

* Adding and sandboxing Latex.

* Creating projects for users.

* Creating the single-page interface.

* Adding commit chains for projects.

* *to be continued as more is completed*
