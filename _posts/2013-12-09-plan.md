I'm wary of giving specific dates for building the website so I'll organize
myself by listing a series of steps that I need to accomplish.

* Laying the foundation ([post][p1]).

* Setting up the deployment process ([post][p2]).

* Creating the user authentication ([post][p3]).

* Adding and sandboxing Latex ([post][p4]).

* Creating projects for users.

* Creating the single-page interface.

* Adding commit chains for projects.

* *to be continued as more is completed*
